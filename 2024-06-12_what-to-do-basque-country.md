# What I recommend to do in the Basque Country

The Basque Country has become a more popular touristic destination in the last few years, which has led to more people asking for recommendations from a local such as myself. I have prioritized stuff that one cannot necesarilly find in guides. Hope you enjoy them :)

## Donostia-San Sebastian

### Food
- [Ubarrechena](https://maps.app.goo.gl/66KDRTnW8kRSzMLN7): mind-blowing paellas.
- [SSua Arde](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ahHLWFejNdJjKMan8): very low-key modern twist to traditional Basque recipes.
- [Baztan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/j7ZXR2C2rGayahpu6): a tourist trap, but it's worth it. Do avoid pick hours though.
- [Juantxo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/q7vw2M8rth6dx7rQ8): you ain't a local until you order a tortilla de patata sandwich in here, preferrably to go.
- [Juanito Kojua](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wo1S81quUUm4gdjX8): fun fact, that's Basque for "Johnny the Cripple" :D Traditional Basque restaurant.

### Other spots
- [Miramar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3FuDdpL8193JYzdS7)
- [Loretopea](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gqAERRzKjyWD2kKSA)
- [Aquarium](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6n9N6GWFrN7YBSAz5)
- [Old town](https://maps.app.goo.gl/E37FmdLbc8ZR7w7T8)
- [Constitution square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ycV9HMM4rKVAZgTH6)
- [Gipuzkoa square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ujQ6Eq41T6hpvaNV9)
- [Mount Ulia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7fmFFB4x9CTEpGB96)

### What I like to do
Have very late breakfast (or very early lunch) with a couple of pintxos in Baztan. Wander around the old town and pop by Mount Ulia, the Aquarium, etc. Come back for late lunch and then wander further away perhaps all the way to Ondarreta or Zurriola. Round it up with dinner.

## Bilbao
As charming as Donosti is with its gorgeous bay, I lived and studied in Bilbao for six years and it holds a dear place in my heart. My inner Real Sociedad fan has a hard time accepting this.

### Food (almost exclusively pintxos)
- Every single bar in [Plaza Barria](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NSJpQhiZHaYKSueu6): bar hoping for several hours just to sit in the terraces doing nothing else than nibling on pintxos while drinking wine, beer, and coffee is a personal favourite.
- [Gaztandegi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/r77AQMryNXLEA86o9) and most of the bars in Garcia Rivero street.
- [Cafe Iruña](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SU4V86834t1fuybG8): open since 1903 and still preserving that early 20th century vibe
- [Arrese](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VQnmRwAxf8FxidKA8): just go in an order a "palmera de chocolate", and ideally a "palmera de coco" too.
- [Mercado de la Rivera](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gc6ZxLZDq2aRjHVd6): just look at the pintxo selection in the Google Maps photos.

### Other spots
- [Museum of Fine Arts of Bilbao](https://maps.app.goo.gl/g9xwoT2p4at7iF9q8)
- [Alhondiga](https://maps.app.goo.gl/G2BdMh6xpYNnEPtT9)
- [Guggenheim Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XGpVv2ScRHnqgK7NA)
- Old town surrounding [the Cathedral](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YFWDngEbhieNiccZ6)
- [Doña Casilda park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pBwUktvehzFzk96D9)

### What I like to do
- Walk from Mercado de la Rivera to the Guggenheim museum along the Nervion river and take detours to nibble: old town, Plaza Barria, Arrese, Garcia Rivero street, etc.

## Hiking
I would say [Wikiloc](https://www.wikiloc.com/) is the most used hiking app over there, downloading it will prove very helpful.

- [Deba-Zumaia](https://www.wikiloc.com/hiking-trails/deba-mirador-virgen-de-itziar-zumaia-por-el-geoparque-de-la-costa-vasca-52388798?utm_medium=app&utm_campaign=share&utm_source=10029655): park your car in Deba, hike to Zumaia and take the train back. One can optionally extend the hike all the way to Zarautz.
- [Camino del Norte](https://caminoways.com/camino-del-norte): [St. James' Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago) has many alternatives, and the northern one goes through the Basque Country. Any of the individual days would be a good choice.
- [Salto del Nervion](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Car95CeHY1eTb3u37): waterfall, very scenic.
- [Oma forest](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iH4zXZKB9dtQTqxP6)

## Surfing
I'm not big on surfing myself, but the Basque Country is supposed to be a solid destination for it.

- [Zarautz](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jee5NnztKqfLXLYW6)
- [Mundaka](https://maps.app.goo.gl/N7NS4Ebyr5T44iMc8): home to the [Mundaka wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mundaka_wave) "considered one of the best lefts of the world".
- [Sopela](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mncnBHmMe2ETPZKT9). If you're into big waves [Punta Galea](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pWKdTL1Qx4HpXpTy8) might have some of that.

## Getaria
Oh, the food in this town... 

- [Elkano](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Lcnn43XjjupzEdAv6): fine dining. Best grilled fish ever, you can quote me on that. Do book several months in advance.
- [Elkano Txiki](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hAXyXECGPA9JGoPv6): that is Basque for "lil' Elkano" :)
- [Kaia Kaipe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eNu2N9pYQnWHe6xZ8): a slightly lower key alternative to Elkano.
- [Itxaspe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FeGfEMSkbJ5fVzmq5): I was neighbours with the owners growing up, I have to give them a shout out.

Fun fact: both [Cristobal Balenciaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crist%C3%B3bal_Balenciaga), founder of the [Balenciaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balenciaga) fashion brand, and [Juan Sebastian Elkano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Sebasti%C3%A1n_Elcano), captain in the first expedition that circumnavigated the world, were born in this town. The first one has [a museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fRDWCGnoj9DpWLdh7) in its honour and the second a few restaurants.
