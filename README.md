Hi! I'm Gorka Era√±a, a Basque fella that somehow (in hindsight happily) found its way to Copenhagen.

Profesionally, after studying mathematics and statistics, I went into data science and for the last couple of years have walked across the tech stack into backend development and API design.

Otherwise, I try to be as intellectual and physically fit as possible by reading, learning, cycling (road, mountain and gravel) and hiking.
